```text
Example 1

Time series = [1,4]
Duration = 2

In 1st second, the duration is 2s (1 to 3)
In 4th second, the duration is 2s (4 to 6)
Hence total duration is 4s
```

```text
Example 2

Time series = [1,2]
Duration = 2

In 1st second, the duration is 2s (1 to 3)
In 2nd second, the duration is 2s (2 to 4)

But here at 2nd second the timer will reset. 
Therefor 1->2 ==> 1s and 2->4=>2s
Hence total duration is 3s
```

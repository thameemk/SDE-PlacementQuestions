## _**Binary Search**_

_Given a list of integer numbers which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target number, write a function to search target number in the given list of numbers. If the target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1._

_You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity._

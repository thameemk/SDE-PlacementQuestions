## **_First Bad Version_**

_You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad._

_Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad._

_Also, implement a function that randomly returns the bad version_
